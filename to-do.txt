--- (Create MongoDB Database)
    -- The goal is to have three different types of users:
        (1) Student 
        (2) Agent
        (3) Property Owner
    -- Based on who is signed in, the program should serve views
        relevant to the type of user.
        # Students should see the different agents on the platform.
        # Agents should see the numerous property owners and students.
        # Propert owners should see different students and agents.
